      </div>
      <p>ZZZ's story is set in New Eridu, the last surviving city after civilization was destroyed by Hollows. A Hollow is a different dimension that can pop up anywhere and contains monsters inside called Ethereals. (Think the Metaverse from Persona 5 or the dungeons in Solo-leveling).</p>
      <p>The Hollow Investigative Association dispatches a team to investigate (Investigators) the Hollow, evacuate residents, implement emergency protocols, etc. The Public Security is basically the police who make sure that people who aren't supposed to be near the Hollow are kept away.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Still, people enter Hollows for many reasons, some of which are illegal in nature. A common reason is to extract Ether, a precious resource only found inside Hollows. There are also people who stay outside of the Hollows but maintain contact with those inside in order to guide them. These people are called Proxies.</p>
      <p>There are also things called Carrots that are used inside Hollows. These are time-sensitive maps that show the best path inside a Hollow. Staying too long inside a Hollow without the capability to adapt to Ether (called Ether Aptitude) can lead to Ether corruption, eventually leading to becoming an Ethereal, which is why Proxy Support is essential to lead Hollow Raiders out of the Hollow in a timely manner before corruption can take place.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The player takes the role of the "Proxy", Belle or Wise (depending on the player's choice), one half of a sibling duo who are collectively known as the legendary "Phaethon". They operate a video rental shop called "Random Play" as a front for their undercover activities as Proxies; individuals who assist Hollow-raiding Agents in navigating the hazardous and ever-changing landscape of Hollows.</p>
      <p>To this end, Phaethon utilizes a Hollow Deep Dive System, or HDD, which allows them to project their consciousness in real-time into a small rabbit-like robot called a Bangboo, as opposed to other publicly-available Hollow observation systems which have a significant time delay on information going to and from a Hollow.</p>

        <img src="miscimages/randomplayzzzabout.webp" alt="Random Play Shop">
      </div>
      <p>As being a Proxy without authorization from New Eridu's Public Security is illegal, the siblings use Random Play as a legitimate cover while they carry out commissions in the various Hollows both within and outside of New Eridu.</p>
      <p>Their Proxy career is secondary to their investigation into "Hollow Zero", the oldest and largest Hollow which is located on the site of the old Eridu city which was destroyed in a massive Hollow disaster approximately 15 years before the events of the game.</p>
