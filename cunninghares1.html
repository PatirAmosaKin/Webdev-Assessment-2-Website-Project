          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Nicole Demara is the founder and current leader of the Cunning Hares odd-job agency. Despite taking on any and all Hollow-related commissions and typically charging a high commission fee, she struggles with finances, leading the Cunning Hares to frequently be in debt, sometimes bordering on bankruptcy. Due to this and her all-or nothing approach, the Cunning Hares have become somewhat infamous in the space, with many clients blacklisting her completely and reviews received on Inter-Knot painting her in an unflattering light.</p>
          <p>Although she has a reputation for being exceedingly cunning and infatuated with money, she is also incredibly savvy when it comes to business, managing to get the Cunning Hares to where they are today, despite her financial misgivings and lack of support. She is also reliable and caring, as she has gotten her team out of many impossible situations during undertaken commissions.</p>
          <p>Nicole is initially one of the only clients of Phaethon that was trusted enough with the secret of their real-world identities, affording her face-to-face meetings with the siblings.</p>
