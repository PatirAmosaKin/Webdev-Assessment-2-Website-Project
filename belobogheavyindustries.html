          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Koleda is the current head of Belobog Industries, and the biological daughter of the company's founder, Khors.</p>
          <p>Her father, Khors, vanished due to a scandal involving embezzlement and fled, which severely shook the company, nearly driving it to the brink of collapse. Once she came of age, Koleda willingly stepped up to untangle the mess, rallying the remaining company workforce and resources to revive the financially and reputationally vulnerable Belobog Heavy Industries.</p>
          <p>With the help of new invaluable team members, Belobog eventually managed to regain its prominence in relevant sectors. Though not as resplendent as its prime, Belobog in its current state is still a notable newcomer in the field. Throughout her journey, Koleda amassed practical life experiences and professional know-how, building a circle of colleagues who back her up like family. Yet, to present herself as a leader, Koleda appears to intentionally adopt a stern tone when communicating with others. This distinct growth trajectory has also contributed to Koleda's heightened maturity in certain aspects compared to her peers.</p>
