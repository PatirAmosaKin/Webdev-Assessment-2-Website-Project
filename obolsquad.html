              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Trigger's kit and characterization have many references to the Greek underworld:
              <ul>
                <li>Trigger's original codename, and then her weapon's name, Phlegethon, is one of the five rivers of the Greek Underworld. It is said to be made of blazing fire.</li>
                <li>Similarly, the other Lyre Squad members are named after the remaining four rivers, with the captain being named after the psychopomp Charon, whose codename Trigger uses to maintain anonimity the first time she worked with Phaethon, during Out of Sight.</li>
                <li>Her Exclusive Channel Sights of Asphodel and her namecard The Bloom of Asphodels are a reference to the Asphodel Meadows, a section of the the Greek underworld covered in asphodels where most of the souls went;</li>
                <li>Her sixth Mindscape Cinema, "Beyond the River of the Dead", references how the Greek Underworld was separated by the living world by a river, especially the Acheron, where the ferryman Charon carried souls from the living shore to the dead shore;</li>
                <li>Her Basic Attack: Harmonizing Shot - Tartarus is a reference to the Tartarus, a deep abyss below the underworld, where the Titans and other enemies of the Olympian gods were imprisoned. In later mythology, it also became a place of damnation for those who sinned against the gods more similar to the concept of hell;</li>
                <li>Her Chain Attack: Stygian Guide is another reference to Charon: while in Greek mythology the river separating the living from the dead was the Acheron, in Roman mythology it was instead the Styx;</li>
                <li>Her Ultimate is called Underworld Requiem.</li>
              </ul>
             <li>The underworld theme is carried on in her Core Skill, Ultimate, and all her Dodge Skills and Special Attacks, since their titles refer to ghosts and funerary rites.</li>
