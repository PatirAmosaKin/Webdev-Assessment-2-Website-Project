          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Caesar King is the daughter of the founder of the biker gang "Calydon." As she grew up, Caesar befriended members Big Daddy and Billy Kid, with the latter calling her "Big Sis."</p>
          <p>One day, Caesar's father mysteriously disappeared, leading to the collapse of the Calydon gang. Orphaned, Caesar was taken in by Big Daddy, who started a new gang, the Sons of Calydon, and raised her to be tough and self-reliant. During the chaos, Caesar was badly injured and lost her left arm. Big Daddy got her help, and she was fitted with a prosthetic made from Billy’s spare arm, boosting her strength and combat ability. At first, she struggled to control it and earned the nickname "King Wreck-It" from Burnice and Piper. But after using her arm to save a child from a landslide, Caesar saw its value and worked to master it.</p>
          <p>Thanks to Big Daddy’s rough guidance, Caesar grew into a strong fighter and local hero, becoming beloved in the Outer Ring. She officially joined the gang after building her first motorcycle with help from Big Daddy and the crew. Eventually, she succeeded him as leader of the Sons of Calydon and rose to become Overlord of the Outer Ring Motor League.</p>

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Luciana de Montefio, whose full name is Luciana Auxesis Theodoro de Montefio, is the daughter of the current head of the prestigious New Eridu Montefio family. Her personality is usually akin to that of a tsundere, seemingly acting harsh when she actually is compassionate and kind underneath, which may have been caused by her severed family ties and Outer Ring life.</p>
          <p>Referring to herself as solely Lucy, due to her real name being far too long and not wanting to be involved with her family, she now performs the role of "Boar Thiren Overseer" for the "Leaps and Bounds Express Services Co.," a name used by the Sons of Calydon for their official logistics business.[</p>
          <p>Due to Lucy being considered a missing person, with there being a sizable reward for her safe return to her family, she prefers to stay in the Outer Ring, seldomly returning to the city. Despite Lucy's best efforts, however, her father is aware of her whereabouts, believing that she will return home by herself at some point, as he himself went through a rebellious phase and ran away from home for over a decade, before eventually returning to don the mantle of the family business and responsibilities.</p>
          <p>Lucy currently spends a lot of her time challenging Caesar King to duels, in the hopes of one day ruling the Outer Ring herself. However, deep down inside she actually cares for her, although she prefers to hide it, feeling flustered if confronted.</p>

          <p>Burnice is also shown to have some immense luck on her side. From being able to survive being majorly harmed by explosives at close range, to winning three million Dennies in the lottery.</p>
