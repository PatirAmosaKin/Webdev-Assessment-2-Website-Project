            <li>Von Lycaon's first name is currently unknown.</li>
            <li>According to Corin, Lycaon uses five whole bottles of 'Ames Special Mechanical Lubricant' when performing maitainence on his legs and always seems to have eight bottles on him.</li>
            <li>Lycaon's name is a reference to the Greek myth of King Lycaon, who cooked his son and served him to Zeus in order to trick him into eating human meat: he was thus punished by the god and transformed into a wolf. The name Lycaon derives from Ancient Greek λῠ́κος (lúkos, “wolf”), which is also the origin of the word "lycanthropy".</li>
            <li>Von is a particle used in German names to indicate a noble lineage. It means "of", thus Von Lycaon's surname is best translated as "of Lycaon".</li>
            <li>Von Lycaon shares the same Chinese voice actor, Wang Yuhang (王宇航), with:

          <h3>Trivia</h3>
          <ul class="trivia-list">
            <li>In Corin's Mindscape Image Full, there is what appears to be a large scar surrounding her right arm, which might be related to the "major surgery" mentioned in her Agent Intel.</li>
            <li>In a now-deleted Twitter post and in her HoYoLab introduction by the official ZZZ account, Corin was mentioned to be 16 years of age. This information has now been scrubbed. The twitter post is as followed: <strong> Um... My name's Corin, 16, from Victoria Housekeeping Co. I'm a Gemini; Rh-negative blood type; I like cleaning. Peel an apple? Can I use my chainsaw? Or maybe an axe —Oh... No? OK, sorry... —Her introduction on Twitter.</strong></li>
            <li>The Inter-Knot post "(Legal Help) I got a cleaning lady but she injured three home invaders," although not specifically stated, heavily implies Corin is the one involved.</li>
            <li>Corin's blood type: RH negative, is the classification for blood that lacks the D antigen, a protein found on the surfaces of red blood cells of people with RH blood.</li>
            <li>Corin's weapon is described as a chainsaw, however, the weapon is more akin to a circular saw on a pole like the head of an axe.</li>
            <li>Corin Wickes shares the same English voice actor, Chloe Eves, with Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and Haypasia in Genshin Impact.</li>
            <li>Corin Wickes shares the same Chinese voice actor, Mufei (沐霏), with:
              <ul>
                <li>Aloy, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and Wanjiru in Genshin Impact</li>

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>Ellen Joe is a laid-back Shark Thiren that attends school in New Eridu who hates activities that require energy. Despite her personality and aloofness, Ellen is a significantly popular student at the school, though she prefers spending time with fellow students Ruby, Monna, and Lynn at karaoke bars, Godfinger and more.</p>
          <p>Ellen's school life is balanced with her job as a maid for Victoria Housekeeping Co., where she specializes in security management and garden maintenance. Though she dislikes physical activities, the support of her teammates that she considers her friend as well, allow her to unleash formidable power, becoming a significant threat in combat. However, this comes at the caveat of consuming a lot of her energy, which is why she has a lollipop on her person at most times.</p>
          <p>Ellen is shown to be constantly tired, possibly an effect of having to attend school and do commissions on a day-to-day basis.</p>
