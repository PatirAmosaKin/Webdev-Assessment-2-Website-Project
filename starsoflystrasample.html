          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>'The Queen' of New Eridu, Astra Yao is a multitalented celebrity mainly known for her singing prowess and impact she had on Ridu's music scene. Examples of her musical prowess include "The Ultimate Voice," which led to a live album from that concert and a videotape labeled "f.f." being released afterwards,[1], the album "Monologue," with the final song being a compilation of interviews she did for the "Jealous" Magazine[2], and "Stars of Lyra," Astra's first album she recorded before her big debut.</p>
          <p>Outside of her stage presence, Astra Yao is a relatively hapless and bubbly young lady, always eager to explore New Eridu, meet fans or spend time with the Legendary Proxy Phaethon. Because of this, she's semi-dependent on her manager/bodyguard/close friend Evelyn Chevalier for daily life.</p>
          <p>Astra is currently signed with Odeum HAE, a record label that is under the entertainment subsidiary of High Ambitions, one of the groups in the TOPS Alliance.</p>

          <p>Evelyn is the manager and personal bodyguard of Ridu's most iconic singer, Astra Yao. Known for her calm, decisive decision-making and professional, efficient style, she's an irreplaceable pillar behind Astra. "In terms of commercial value, if Astra Yao represents the 1, then Evelyn is all the 0s that follow," a reporter from an entertainment magazine stated.</p>
          <p>Evelyn is skilled at planning comprehensive schedules and product endorsements, while also ensuring Astra Yao's safety during any unexpected situations. "Want to get close to Astra Yao? You'll have to get past Evelyn Chevalier first..." Though she's always busy with work, Evelyn never seems overwhelmed, and she has an almost obsessive attention to detail, ensuring that every performance and every product endorsement goes through her strict scrutiny. But strangely, such an exceptional manager is not trusted by her parent company, Odeum HAE.</p>
          <p>Evelyn's role seems to go beyond just being a manager and personal bodyguard; there seems to be an "organization" behind her.</p>

          <ul class="trivia-list">
            <li>Evelyn Chevalier is also known by these aliases or titles:
              <ul>
                <li>Scheele's Green (Fugue codename)[1]</li>
                <li>Bella</li>
                <li>Ella</li>
                <li>Sophia</li>
                <li>Shana</li>
                <li>Glenn</li>
                <li>Flying Squirrel</li>
                <li>Lily</li>
                <li>Anna</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Though Evelyn is seen using her garrote for its intended purpose, the addition of a knife at the end and usage has it resemble a rope dart more.</li>
            <li>Her given name "Evelyn" is a name of English origin meaning "desired," whilst her family name "Chevalier" is of French origin and means "Knight."</li>
            <li>Her Fugue codename, Scheele's Green, is an arsenic compound that used to be employed as a green pigment before the discovery of its toxicity. Mistaken as a harmless dye, its pervasive presence in the late Victorian society caused many poisonings and deaths, including wallpaper poisoning.</li>
            <li>Her garrote's name, Lunalux, is a portmanteau of the Latin words luna "moon" and lux "light", which is probably a calque of the English word "moonlight."</li>
            <li>Evelyn's Arcade name is also Lunalux, likely in reference to her garrote.</li>
            <li>Evelyn Chevalier shares the same Chinese voice actor, Li Chanfei (李蝉妃), with:

                <li>Caterina in Honkai Star Rail</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Evelyn Chevalier shares the same Japanese voice actor, Hikasa Yōko (日笠 陽子), with:
              <ul>
                <li>Emilie in Genshin Impact</li>
